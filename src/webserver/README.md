## webserver goes here

### Minimum Requirements for Webserver / Web Page
1. Display a world map with dots representing cities that weather data is being
continously gathered for

2. Display the temperature difference for each dot using color, and have an
interpolation scheme for display average temperature difference for the
entire map

3. Have a legend for the color difference (red will mean hotter now compared to
historical data and blue will mean colder now compared to historical data with
white being no difference and dark reds / blues meaning a bigger difference in
comparison to historical data.)

4. A button for manual refresh, though the map should refresh every 15 seconds.

### Extra Features

1. Be able to zoom into the map - easy if we make the map just an SVG that is
sent by the server.

2. On zoom in, can see the names of the cities / points of data collection?

3. Hover over a point of data to see a text book that says the location / name
of the point and the temperature difference compared to historical data.
