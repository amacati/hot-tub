			  <h1 class="display-3">About Hot Tub</h1>
			  <p class="lead">Hot Tub is a final project for the Data Intensive
			  	Computing lecture at KTH 2020. The aim of this project was to
			  	build a data processing pipeline using high-scalability
				frameworks such as Spark. We chose to implement a real-time
				global warming monitor. Our heatmap shows the temperature
				difference of the last 24 hours compared to the preindustrial
				average on that day. This way, we hope to make climate change
				more tangible for people not accustomed to the methods and
				language of scientific analysis. The reference model is
				generated from historical data stemming from the Berkeley Earth
				dataset. Our real-time model gets synthesized from records we
				obain from the from the OpenWeatherMapAPI. Each sampling point
				gets send over Kafka and consumed by a SparkStreaming node which
				formats and inserts the entries into a Cassandra database. In
				parallel, our interpolation node uses pyspark and scipy to load
				the averaged samples from the database, build the model by
				interpolation and produce a temperature difference heatmap. This
				model is displayed in our webserver.
