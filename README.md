## Run the project

All services can be started by using Docker compose. From the project's root folder, run
> ```sh
> <user>:~$ docker-compose up
> ```

The webserver should be reachable at localhost:5000. 

> **_NOTE:_** You absolutely need either the Berkeley Earth dataset (which is not uploaded to the git repository due to size limitations), or a complete
> historical_average.csv dataset, which is generated by running a special script once. For the Berkeley Earth dataset, we use the Daily Land (Experimental;
> 1880 – Recent) Average Temperature (TAVG) 1º x 1º Latitude-Longitude Grid data set. If you do not have the datasets, run the [model_creator](/src/batch_processing/reference_model/model_creator.py) script once. The 
> script assumes that the data is present at /data/Complete_TAVG_Daily_LatLong1_1880.nc. Again, to keep the repository size small, the dataset is not included
> in the files. It can be downloaded from http://berkeleyearth.org/archive/data/.

## Documentation
Both the [project proposal](/documentation/proposal.pdf) and the [final report](/documentation/final_report.pdf) can be found in the documentation folder. 
It also contains a detailed code documentation. You can access the documentation by running 

> ```sh
> <user>:~$ firefox documentation/html/index.html
> ```
